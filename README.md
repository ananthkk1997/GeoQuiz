# GeoQuiz
A simple Android application to test the user's knowledge of Geography.

*This application was made with the help of the Big Nerd Ranch: Android Programming book.*

# About
This was a very simple application. It was just my way of getting started in Android development and learning about Activity lifecycles, the different Views, xml, listeners, etc. This application loads many true-or-false questions about Geography and quizzes the user. The player is given True and False buttons to answer. Upon answer selection, the app displays a Toast to indicate "Correct" or "Incorrect" and advances to the next question.
